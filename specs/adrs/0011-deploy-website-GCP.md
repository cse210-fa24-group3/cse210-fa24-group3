# Deploy Website Though Google Cloud Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our developer journaling web application requires a robust, scalable, and secure cloud deployment strategy. We need a comprehensive approach to hosting, scaling, and maintaining the application with minimal operational overhead while ensuring high availability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.

## Decision
We will deploy the web application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a multi-service architecture that leverages containerization and managed services. It will enable the robust networking and security configurations.


## Consequences
### Positive:
-	GCP Offers robust features like automatic scaling, high availability, and strong security in technical advantages
-	Reduces operational overhead with managed services and streamlined deployment in operation.
-	Provides advanced networking capabilities for efficient traffic management.

### Negative:
-	Has technical limitations as it can be complex, requiring specialized skills and careful configuration.
-	May face performance issues like cold start latency and network complexity.
-	Susceptible to service outages and security vulnerabilities may expose to risk, necessitating robust security practices.
