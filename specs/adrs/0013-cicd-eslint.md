# ADR 0009: CI-CD Pipeline with ESLint Workflow

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our team is developing a developer journal application that requires a robust and consistent code quality process. As the project scales and more developers collaborate, we need an automated system to maintain code standards, prevent potential bugs, and ensure code quality before deployment.

## Decision
We will implement a CI-CD pipeline that includes an ESLint workflow as a critical validation step before deployment. The ESLint workflow will:
* Validate code formatting
* Check for potential code quality issues
* Prevent deployment of code that does not meet our defined standards
* Provide immediate feedback to developers about code quality

## Consequences

### Positive
* Consistent code formatting across the project
* Early detection of potential code quality issues
* Automated quality control without manual review
* Reduced risk of introducing bugs or poorly formatted code
* Improved overall code maintainability
* Provides a clear, automated gate for code quality

### Negative
* Initial setup time for configuring ESLint rules
* Potential friction for developers who need to adjust their coding style
* Additional build time in the CI-CD pipeline
* Requires ongoing maintenance of linting rules

## Implementation Details
* Tool: ESLint
* Trigger: Automatically run on every pull request and before deployment
* Action on Failure: Block deployment and send notification to the development team
* Notification Method: GitHub Actions notification

## Related Decisions
* ADR 0003: Node.js for Backend Framework
* ADR 0002: Frontend Technology Selection

## Alternatives Considered
* Manual code reviews
* Using alternative linters (Prettier, TSLint)
