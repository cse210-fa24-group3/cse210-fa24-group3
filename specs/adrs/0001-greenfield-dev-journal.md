# Greenfield Developer Journal

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our final project for CSE 210 can be either a brownfield (modify existing) or greenfield (completely new) project. The greenfield project must be based on a developer journal, developer dashboard, or developer tool, while the brownfield project can address any topic as long as it meets tech stack constraints. There are several open source platforms that already cater to the needs that a greenfield project would address, however it can be time consuming to select a brownfield project that meets constraints and is easy to pick up. 

## Decision
For our project, we will create a greenfield developer journal website. We are starting from scratch rather than exisiting code so that we can spend less time getting familiar with someone else's code, learning a new tech stack, and dealing with the existing issues that are inherently present in brownfield project code. 

## Consequences
### Positive
- Full control over the code allows us to select the exact tools and tech stack
- There is more flexibility and control over what we can do since we are not limited by existing code and structure
- Simpler to understand the code since we do not need to spend time reading over and learning existing code
- We won't have to handle the existing issues in code that are inherently a part of a brownfield project
- We can spend less time searching for an appropriate brownfield project

### Negative
- The development of the initial build and a working version of the project will take longer and require more than using an existing project would
- Makes it easier to overengineer the project and end up in rabbit holes
- There are many existing developer journals, so our project would be competing with larger, established platforms
