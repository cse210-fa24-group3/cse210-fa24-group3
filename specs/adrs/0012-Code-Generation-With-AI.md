# GitHub Integration for Activity Tracking and File Saving

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Developers often need rapid prototyping and code generation assistance. Our journaling app aims to provide an intelligent template system that can generate code based on user-specified requirements. Create a corresponding template(tool) that can leveraging AI capabilities to create context-aware and precise code generation.

## Decision
We will implement an AI-driven code generation template system need to use advanced language models for contextual code generation, and provide flexible input mechanisms for code generation requirements. Implement robust prompt engineering techniques and ensure generated code meets best practices and follows standard conventions.


## Consequences
### Positive:
 -	Respect intellectual property guidelines and able to provide clear attribution for generated code
 -  Implement user-configurable generation parameters
 -  Trustful AI will maintain high-quality, standards-compliant output

### Negative:
 -  The Over-reliance on AI generated code may have inconsistent code quality
 -  Potential security vulnerabilities due to the model adapts and may have complex error handling
