# Frontend Framework Specifications

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our team is going to develop a new developer journal. To implement this journaling tool, we will need to use JavaScript and HTML to develop the frontend. We want the framework to use a tech stack that is easy for our team to learn quickly. We have considered various frontend frameworks such as React and Vue, but will stick with a simpler frameowkr given project constraints and our timeline. 

## Decision
We will use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and custom CSS for the frontend of our project as our team already knows these tools and doing so will help prevent overengineering the developer journal or spending extra time on learning new tools.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Lightweight framework, allows faster load times
- Reduces external dependencies and consequently improves maintainability
- Promotes focus on simplicity, hopefully preventing overeingeering the project
- Custom CSS allows us to be entirely in control of it and provides additional flexibility
- Allows faster development as the team is already familiar with it and does not need to spend time learning a new tech stack

### Negative
- Less advanced functionality compared to other tools
- Less easily scalable than React
- May end up having to reinvent features that already exist in libraries like React
