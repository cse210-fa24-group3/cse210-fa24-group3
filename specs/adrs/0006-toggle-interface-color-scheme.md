# Button to Toggle Interface Color Scheme

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The ability to toggle between a light mode and dark modes is a popular feature among users from many different applications. This feature enhances the user experience and allows more personalization to the developer journal. Implementing this feature would require a simple and intuitive method for users to switch between the two themes.

## Decision
We will implement a button that allows users to switch between light and dark display modes in the developer journal to allow the user more customization options for their journal. The toggle button will be easily accessible from the journal's homepage header so that it is easy for the user to locate.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Allows more user customization, which is popular
- Should have minimal impact on app performance
- Can be implemented with the existing frontend tech stack

### Negative
- Potential delay when changing between light and dark mode
- Slight increase in CSS complexity
