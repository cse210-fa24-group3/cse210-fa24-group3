# ADR 0010: Code Quality Monitoring with Codecov in CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our developer journal application requires comprehensive code quality monitoring throughout the development process. We need a robust solution that can:
* Provide detailed code coverage insights
* Integrate seamlessly with our existing CI/CD workflow
* Offer actionable feedback on code quality
* Ensure code quality is maintained at multiple stages of deployment

## Decision
We will implement Codecov as our primary code quality monitoring tool in the CI/CD pipeline, integrated at two critical stages:
1. After ESLint validation
2. Following end-to-end (E2E) testing

## Alternatives Considered
* Codeclimate
* Codacy

## Implementation Strategy

### Workflow Integration
* First Stage: After ESLint Validation
 - Trigger Codecov analysis
 - Check code coverage and quality metrics
 - Block further progression if quality standards are not met

* Second Stage: Post E2E Testing
 - Conduct comprehensive code coverage analysis
 - Verify maintained code quality across different testing scenarios
 - Provide detailed reporting and potential improvement insights

## Consequences

### Positive
* Comprehensive code quality monitoring
* Automated quality checks without manual intervention
* Detailed insights into code coverage
* Consistent quality standards across development stages
* Early detection of potential code quality issues
* Supports continuous improvement of codebase

### Negative
* Additional complexity in CI/CD pipeline
* Potential increase in build time

## Implementation Details
* Tool: Codecov
* Integration Points:
 - GitHub Actions
 - Post-ESLint workflow
 - Post-E2E testing workflow
* Reporting: Detailed coverage reports
* Quality Gates: Configurable quality thresholds

## Related Decisions
* ADR 0003: Node.js for Backend Framework
* ADR 0004: CI-CD Pipeline with ESLint Workflow

## Configuration Considerations
* Define minimum acceptable code coverage percentage
* Set up notifications for quality degradation
* Establish baseline and progressive improvement targets
