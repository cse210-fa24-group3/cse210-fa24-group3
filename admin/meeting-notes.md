# Meeting Notes
## 10/25/2024
- Reviewed assignment document
- Green Field vs Brown Field
    - Sneha thinks green is better, it provides a clean slate and you don't need to learn the existing base. Existing projects have existing problems.
    - Aryan says greenfield
    - Amy thinks green, but we need to be very careful to not overengineer it, which we tend to do
    - Andrew originally thought brownfield since it gives you a starting point, but he agrees there will be a learning curve to the project. Overall, open to both approaches
    - Keqian is open to both
    - Krithika prefers greenfield
    - Venu also votes greenfield since learning a new system is very time consuming
- Final Verdict: Green field
- TA Meeting Recap
    - Using react in the warm up was too much, itâ€™s overengineering. Stick to plain JS
    - The TA wants the big decisions communicated early to him, not just in grading
        - Remember that if we want to use any library or any additional tool, we must consult with Kashish
    - Loved the ADRs, their detail, and the documentation
    - He also liked the CI/CD Pipeline
    - We need to do github workflows
- Next Meeting: Sunday 5pm
    - In person meeting, Aryan will call in
    - Find existing versions of green field examples with links 
        - Developer Focused Journal Tool 
        - Developer Focused Dashboard 
        - Developer Productivity Tool 
    - Keep it simple
