# CI/CD Pipeline Report
## Overview

This report details the current state of our CI/CD pipeline, which consists of three main workflows:

- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Deployment workflow**
- **End-to-End (E2E) testing** for UI validation

The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality and proper functionality before any code is merged into the main branch.

## Current Functional Components

### 1. ESLint Workflow
- **Status:** Functional
- **Functionality:**
  - Automatically triggered on pull request creation
  - Enforces code style and formatting standards
  - Checks code indentation
  - Acts as a required gateway for subsequent steps
  - Blocks PR if checks fail

### 2. Deployment Workflow
- **Status:** Functional
- **Functionality:**
  - Triggered after successful ESLint checks
  - Handles build and deployment processes
  - Acts as a prerequisite for E2E testing
  - Integrated with pull request workflow

### 3. E2E UI Testing Workflow
- **Status:** Functional
- **Functionality:**
  - Implements UI automation testing using Mocha
  - Runs comprehensive UI test suite
  - Final validation step before merge approval
  - Triggered after successful deployment

## Pipeline Flow

1. Developer creates a pull request to merge into the main branch
2. ESLint workflow automatically initiates
3. Upon ESLint success, deployment workflow triggers
4. Successful deployment triggers E2E testing
5. All passes are required for merge approval

## Next Sprint Components

- **Automated Document Generation**
  - Implement an automated documentation pipeline
  - Generate technical documentation from code

- **Enhanced Code Quality Tools**
  - Implement additional code quality metrics
  - Integration with existing ESLint workflow

## Conclusion

The current pipeline provides a robust foundation for our CI/CD process. All three main workflows are functioning as intended, creating a reliable path from development to deployment. Future enhancements will focus on:

- Implementing automated documentation generation
- Enhancing code quality tools
